Everyone knows you can write code to do things, but can you write the same thing using only types?

Challenges are listed in the `src/` directory:

1. (`★★☆☆☆`) [Reverse](./src/Reverse.ts)

Common utilities are provided in `src/common`:

- [`Assert.ts`](./src/common/Assert.ts)
- [`RetainMutability.ts`](./src/common/RetainMutability.ts)
- [`UnknownArray.ts`](./src/common/UnknownArray.ts)
