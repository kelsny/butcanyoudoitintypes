## Yes, but can you do it in types?

> A collection of challenges which you complete in solely the type system.

Everyone knows you can write code to do things, but can you write the same thing using only types?

Challenges are listed in the `src/` directory:

1. (`★★☆☆☆☆`) [ReverseTuple](./src/ReverseTuple.ts)
2. (`★★★☆☆☆`) [DeleteCharacter](./src/DeleteCharacter.ts)
3. (`★★★★☆☆`) [MiddleCharacter](./src/MiddleCharacter.ts)
4. (`★★☆☆☆☆`) [IncludesString](./src/IncludesString.ts)

Some common utility types you may use in your solutions are provided in `src/utility`:

- [`RetainMutability.ts`](./src/utility/RetainMutability.ts)
- [`UnknownArray.ts`](./src/utility/UnknownArray.ts)

Testing-related types and mock data can be found in `src/common`:

- [`Assert.ts`](./src/common/Assert.ts)
